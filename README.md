1. I can also output the index and value of elements for making required sum 
by keeping backlinks pelase let me know if that is required. 
2. This repo only includes the files of input and output after running my java
code for subset sum problem ( using knapsack ). if you want the java code of subset sum problem 
i. using knapsack 
ii. using approximation algorithm (time complexity : O(min {n/e, n+(1/e)2 log(1/e)}), 
space complexity : O(n+1/e) where e is accuracy and n is number of items )

and file to generate random input please select my bid or message me ( my freelancer.com
